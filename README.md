# City Hall Hack Night: Civic ⚡ Lighting Talks
### Tuesday, September 5, 2017

### [RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code4Sac/events/242619998/)

City Hall Hack Nights are monthly Code for Sacramento meetups that take place inside of City Hall. Our goal is to foster a deeper relationship between public servants and the civic tech community. We believe that a strong relationship will help surface meaningful, right-sized problems for which the community can co-create open source solutions.

## About Civic ⚡ Lightning Talks

Civic Lightning Talks are your opportunity to be heard **in 5 minutes or less!** Talks can be virtually anything of a civic nature:
- Pain points in public services
- Opportunities to improve quality of life (e.g., health, mobility, housing, public safety, economic development, etc.)
- Interesting civic technologies or platforms
- New perspectives on public policy
- Emerging methods and processes for sovling problems

Please note that talks should not be of a *political* nature. That is, they should not be focused on any particular elected officials or political parties. That stuff is boring.

## Frequently Asked Questions (thanks [SacJS!](https://github.com/sacjs/sacjs.github.io/blob/master/speaking.md))

#### Do I need to be an expert to talk?

Absolutely not!

Our meetup is laid back and our attendees are friendly. We welcome speakers of all skill levels and enjoy learning about a wide variety of topics.

#### What kind of talks are you looking for?

All manner of civic issues - tech or non-tech - are  welcome, but we'd love to hear about open data, data visualization, blockchain, machine learning, or anything else with the potential for civic innovation!

The more creative, the better!

#### How long should my talk be?

Lightning talk days are limited to a maximum of 5 minutes.

#### What's the A/V situation?

We have a digital projector with an HDMI input and in-room audio.

#### Do I need to submit my slides beforehand?

No, but please show up at least 10 minutes before the meetup. This allows us to check you in, brief you on the agenda, get you fed, and buffer around any surprise traffic situations.

#### Is there time for any Q&A?

This depends on the number of talks that will be given. We encourage all speakers to hold off on answering any questions from the floor during their presentations. Please stay around afterwards when you can answer any questions from our attendees in a less formal environment.

## Code of Conduct

The City of Sacramento expects all speakers and attendees to follow Code for Sacramento's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/code4sac/codeofconduct).

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our meetup group are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

**tl;dr: Be excellent with each other**
